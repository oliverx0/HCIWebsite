									<h2>Pallette - The Tongue-Computer Interface!</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Currently quadriplegics do not have a mobile, discreet method of finely controlling the technology used in their daily lives. We envision a tongue interface capable of controlling technology to enable more independent living. The tongue is one of the most sensitive and versatile muscles in the body, it is also concealed within the mouth. Though previous attempts of using the tongue as an interface for technology exist, none of them have succeeded in achieving a comfortable and lasting experience for the users while enabling control of multiple technologies.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have created a tongue interface for mouse control with the long term goal of enabling greater independence through control of technology. Our base design is based off of the concept of the mouse. By taking a universal input device normally used by the hand and configuring it for the tongue, we enable SCI patients to use any technology normally facilitated by conventional mouse control. Our device is held in place by a retainer (our prototype, by a mouthguard), providing 2 buttons for commands and a trackpoint for navigation and direction. It has been contoured very carefully to fit the upper dome of the mouth and has established comfortable, simple control in testing.

								<h3>Pallette's Design</h3>

								<p>
									The final prototype possesses the functions of a mouse, except that instead of operating it with hands and limbs it sits on the roof of the mouth and is operated with the tongue. The design incorporates three elements. Two clickable buttons are mounted as large-area buttons on the left and right sides of the interface, and a pressure-sensitive trackpoint nub is mounted in between. The pressure sensitive nub can be pushed in all directions with a continuous spectrum of movement spanning a 2-D plane. (For reference, this “trackpoint nub” is the same as the red blip mouse found on most IBM thinkpad laptops). This nub controls a mouse cursor. The size and texture of the button clicks have been made tactile through lever motion of plastic and wide button caps. The trackpoint tip is concave, enabling the tip of the tongue to grip and better direct the cursor.

								</p>

								<p>
									We also incorporated trackpoint sensitivity sensitivity within the source code allowing us to easily increase or decrease the sensitivity as desired. In fact, we can even scale sensitivity for a specific axis, X or Y. We found this helped greatly given the strength and precision of a tongue differs from person to person. Also the agility of the tongue is different from left to right contrasted with front to back.

								<h3>Pallette's Previous Prototypes</h3>

								<h4>Initial Low-Fi Prototypes</h4>

								<p>
									To initally prototype our tongue-controlled interface, we created two sets of prototypes; one set to asses the haptic function of button pressing using a modified calculator, and another to asses the form of the interface inside the mouth. Both prototype sets were meant to rest against the top of the mouth and interfaced by the tongue from below. 

								</p>

								<p>
									The first prototype consisted of a $4 <strong>calculator</strong>, which was used to test the ability of users to perform operations with their tongue. The idea behind it was to ask users to press different buttons and see based on the results of the scree if their input was correct. This would give us an idea of how easy it is to control a button set inside the mouth. 

								</p>

								<figure>
									<img class="image_pallette" src="images/calculator.png" alt="Calculator Prototypes">
									<figcaption>Versions 1 and 2 of the calculator-based prototype</figcaption>
								</figure>

								<p>
									Version 1 of the calculator-based protoype was constructed from a full portable calculator. The prototype was wrapped in plastic, with the button portion being placed in the person’s mouth. The designer asked the person to press certain buttons or perform certain operations and the person attempted to do so. Participants complained about the large size; some people could barely fit the keypad into their mouth. Furthermore while the buttons were easy to push by hand, they were difficult to push by the tongue. Buttons towards the back of the keypad were hardest to push, as participants found it difficult to reach towards the back of their mouth. Buttons were easiest to press in immediate circumference around the center of the keypad. 

								</p>

								<p>
									Version 2 attempted to address these concerns by reducing the size of the keypad and reducing tactile load required to press the buttons. The the keypad was folded and clamped with tape, and the buttons were replaced with conductive metal slats. These slats enabled a button press with a gentle tap of the tongue.
								</p>

								<p>
									The second protype consisted of <strong>foam forms</strong>, which were used to address the sensation of a user having something in his mouth designed to be used for longer periods of time. This would give us an initial impression of what it might feel like to use our tongue- interface technology. It also gave us, the designers, an impression of how complicated it might be to fit the buttons to be handled by the user within the constraints of the shape of the mouth without being uncomfortable.
								</p>

								<figure>
									<img class="image_pallette" style="width: 400px" src="images/foam.png" alt="Foam Prototypes">
									<figcaption>Versions 1 - 3 of the foam-based prototype</figcaption>
								</figure>

								<p>
									Version 1 attempted to create a thin, less defined form as a staring base to understand how big we could make the form within the confines of the mouth. This first guess proved to be too big to reasonably fit in the mouth. When used it looked like a blue tongue sticking out of the mouth.
								</p>

								<p>
									Version 2 reduced the size and profile of version 1 according to one of our participants feelings on sizing. After an initial trial, the form was curved to better fit the curvature of the mouth. This form fit with adequate space, and the participant felt like they were able to comfortably reach the majority of exposed real estate. The two most prominent complaints were 1) the prototype was not attached to the top of the mouth and would sometimes float around and 2) it did not include an identifiable buttons and therefore left the interface mapping up to the imagination.

								</p>

								<p>		
									Using the form factor of version 2, version 3 was created with a button and control layout. It has not been tested with participants yet, although a small test by one of the designers yielded that the buttons were recognizable by the tongue quite well despite their small size, and that some of this interface should be streamlined with less number of elements and more distinct elements to individual touch.

								</p>

								<h4>Mid-Fi Prototypes</h4>

								<p>
									Based on the users’ feedback during the previous prototype versions, we kept testing different materials to get a better understanding of what might be comfortable for the user. In that sense, we tried materials that varied from chocolate and cheese to plastic and foam. This helped us understand different textures that might be familiar for the user when using our product. We then proceeded to address the problem of operating with our previous prototype that used a calculator screen to indicate success of operations. This time around we built a more robust prototype that: a) had a shape that allowed for easy insertion in the mouth, and b) was able to perform the operations of turning lights on and off with 2 different buttons.

								</p>

								<figure>

									<figcaption>Design of the Mid-Fi Protype</figcaption>
								</figure>

								<p>
									The tools used for building our prototype consisted of: Arduino (to make all the connections to the buttons and the lights and program it so that on a button push the lights would turn on), LED lights, Pushable buttons (that would activate the LED lights), and Plastic which would cover the buttons and work as our device to be put inside the mouth. The shape of this plastic cover was modified through heat. Tape was sued to keep everything together, cables were used to connect the buttons to LEDs, and plastic bags were used to allow for multiple uses of our prototypes by different people.

								</p>

								<p>
									Previous versions of the material used in our prototype included stuffs, which were helpful to address what the shape of the device should be, but the feeling was not very much liked during the heuristic evaluation. Because of this, we decided to then go with plastic, which has so far been very successful.
